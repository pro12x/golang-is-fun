# MYSTERY

### About
**Mystery** is a guessing game. At each game or level, a number is chosen at random in a given interval which the player will have to guess to move on to the next level.

### Rules

**Mystery** is a simple game with an unlimited number of levels. You have five credits for each level,  if you run out of credits the  game ends.  Your score increases according to your level, which  means that the  more you advance  the greater your gains will be.  Your main objective is to guess the mystery number,  if you find  it you could go to the next level.
